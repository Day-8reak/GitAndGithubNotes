    What is git?

Git is open-spource and free "Source Control Management", also referred to SCM

Ex:
We want to fix a mistake on our website: 
so we can make a branch (another version of the website),
Then with this we can merge to our main after we're happy with the changes
We can then commit and then push those changes
- We can also revert back to a previous version if that wasn't a mistake

We can run git bash as a terminal, but we can use any terminal we want to
run git


    Git bash configuration startup:
config your name: git config --global user.name "Maxwell Huang"
email: git config --global user.email Maximumhuanging@gmail.com
default branch: git config --global init.default branch main

We can use clear as well, and we use cd to change directories
- to turn a given file into a git repo we type "git init"
When we do this it's still untracked, so git doesn't care

But, if you track a file, you can revert back to a previous version if you want to
- to track a file we write:
git add fileName
- to untrack a file we can:
git rm --cached fileName

To check the status of your repo (what's untracked and stuff):
git status


Whenever we change/add to/edit a file it will tell you after running "git status"
- This will move it from a file under "changes not staged for commit" to "changeds stages for commit


To untrack a file we can:
git rm --cached <fileName>


    .gitignore
To ignore certain files, folders, etc we can create a document named .gitignore 

To make sure certain files are being ignored we type git status after modifying a file to be ignored
To make sure certain files are being ignored we type git status after modifying a file to be ignored
- .gitignore only ignores files created after it was created
- So to ignore a file we either have to remove it from the git repo
- Or we have to create a new file/rename it 

We can track all the files by typing:
git add -A 
Or
git add --all



    Commiting and other stages
When all files are tracked it means are in an environment called "Staging"
- staging is like a holding pen until you're ready to commit
Commiting is just taking a snapshot of the repository
 at the current moment 

Sort of like writing an entry in a journal, we can always
go back and visit it

command for commiting:
git commit -m "Message"


To check the differences between the
last commit and the current state of the project
we type:
git diff
red text is old text, green is new text.

3 different stages:
    1. Working files: These are the untracked files
    2. Staging: In-between phase, files in this stage after using git add
    3. Commit: this is where we push it to the official repository on github

If we added a change (moved it to staging), but we don't
like the changes then we can use:
git restore --staged <fileName> (more than 1)

This doesn't actually remove the changes,
it just moves the file back to untracked


We can also skip the staging stage:
git commit <options> "message"

test

deleting a file completely (and not just from the repository):
    git rm <fileName>
The issue is that git tells us if we deleted a file
